### 👋 Hi, I'm **Os** — aka **Osman Vision**

I’m a creator and builder who loves making tools that are clean, focused, and actually useful.

- 🧑‍💻 I build open-source tools, scripts, and workflows
- 🌐 Interested in creative automation, productivity, and visual content
- ⚒️ Always experimenting with Python, minimal UX, and lightweight systems

### 🚀 My Projects

🧩 Currently working on a **custom mobile keyboard** — focused on expressive stickers, clean UX, and future AI integration. This will evolve into a full experience with a bear-like assistant and smart tools built right into the keyboard — and much more.

🛒 Also planning a thoughtfully designed grocery & essentials app — focused on smart organization, shared lists, and a smooth experience for everyday use.
